# Encounter Jesus

Welcome to **Encounter Jesus Fellowship**. We are happy that you found us. 

Our hope is to be a Christ-centered fellowship and ministry for people to gather, find commuity, and grow in faith, and most importantly--to **ENCOUNTER JESUS**!!!

We are not a church.

We will be meeting weekly on Saturdays @7:30PM.

**WHO YOU ARE: In your twenties, recent college grad looking for community, mentorship, and purpose in the season you're in.
